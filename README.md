# react-semantic-ui-kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shinzui/react-semantic-ui-kit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shinzui/react-semantic-ui-kit)

[Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) rebuilt as React components.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

 - I needed a comprehensive UI component library to use on my side projects.
 - I am unsatisfied with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (including boostrap 4 alpha) and [Foundation for sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
 - I wanted to learn how to use Semantic UI.

## Goals

 - Create components for Semantic UI widgets without using any of Semantic UI's javascript.

## Current status

The project is under heavy development. The goal is to initially implement all components without their javascript behaviors for the [0.2 milestone](https://github.com/shinzui/react-semantic-ui-kit/milestones/0.2).
Please check the demo to see what's already implemented.

To run the demo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/shinzui/react-semantic-ui-kit.git
    $ cd react-semantic-ui-kit && npm install && npm run demo

Then go to http://localhost:8080/demo

Alternatively, you can look at the [closed component issues](https://github.com/shinzui/react-semantic-ui-kit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A0.2+) which has all the
**fully implemented** Semantic UI components.

Please note that the API will likely change as I use it on my projects.
